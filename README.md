# The Node Pack

This is the source code for the mods that can be found on the Minecraft Forums. [The Node Pack forum page](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1272485-1-0-0-the-node-pack)

I had lost this code for the longest time. I'm not even sure if this is the latest version published to the forums. But it was in an old SVN server I used to use, so I thought I'd upload it. :)

The files I found didn't have any of the images used, so I have included the resources from the downloadable mod file.

If I find a more up-to-date of complete version of these files, I'll upload it here.

Huge credit goes out to my dad Grant who played these mods more than anyone else I know.

Also thanks to razer, nameless023 and DE3000 from minecraftforum.net for their help and ideas.

I'm not actively maintaining these, you're welcome to use as inspiration! :)
